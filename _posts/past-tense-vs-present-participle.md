In creative writing, the use of past tense and present participle can create distinct effects and narratives. Here's a brief comparison with examples:

## Past Tense

The past tense is commonly used to narrate events that have already occurred. It conveys a sense of completion and distance from the present moment. This approach is often used in traditional storytelling, where the narrator recounts a series of events that have already taken place.

Example:
>She walked down the street, her footsteps echoing in the quiet evening. The wind rustled the leaves, and she pulled her jacket tighter around her.

## Present Participle

The present participle, also known as the "-ing" form, is used to describe ongoing or continuous actions. This approach can create a more immediate and immersive feel, as the reader experiences the events as they unfold. It can be particularly effective in creating a sense of immediacy and capturing the flow of thoughts and actions.

Example:
>Stepping out into the night, she felt the cool breeze caress her face. Leaves rustling in the wind, she quickened her pace, her heart pounding with each stride.

In the examples above, the past tense in the first example conveys a sense of the narrator recounting a series of events that have already occurred, while the present participle in the second example immerses the reader in the moment, creating a more immediate and visceral experience.

The choice between past tense and present participle in creative writing depends on the desired effect and the overall narrative style. Past tense can provide a more traditional and structured approach, while present participle can lend a more immediate and dynamic feel to the writing.
