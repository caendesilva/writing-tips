Action beats are physical actions or movements that a character performs, used to convey emotions or enhance the scene, while dialogue tags are phrases like "he said" or "she asked" that attribute spoken lines to characters. Action beats can add depth and context to dialogue, while dialogue tags primarily clarify who is speaking.

Here are some examples to illustrate the concepts:

**"Action beat":**
- "Get out of here!" she shouted, her voice trembling with fear.
- John slammed his fist on the table. "I won't accept this!"
- Quickly, she glanced around the room, searching for a way to escape.

**"Dialogue tag":**
- "I can't believe you did that," he said, shaking his head in disappointment.
- "The plan is simple, we just need to be careful," she explained, her brow furrowed in concentration.
- "Don't you dare touch that!" he yelled, his face turning red with anger.

Both styles are commonly used in fiction writing, and there is no inherently "best" style. The choice often depends on the author's preference, the pacing and rhythm of the scene, and the overall narrative style. Some writers may alternate between the two styles within the same work to create variety and emphasis.

For example, an author might use the "action beat" style to create a sense of urgency and immediacy in a fast-paced action scene, while relying more on "dialogue tags" in a slower, more reflective conversation. The variation in style can help to keep the pacing and flow of the narrative engaging for the reader.
