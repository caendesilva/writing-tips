## Active Voice

In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action described by the verb. This makes the writing more direct, concise, and engaging. Active voice is generally preferred in creative writing as it creates a stronger, more dynamic narrative.

**Example:**

```
The author crafted a captivating story.
```

## Passive Voice

In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb. This can make the writing feel more detached, ambiguous, or less immediate. Passive voice should be used sparingly in creative writing, as it can weaken the impact of the narrative.

**Example:**

```
The captivating story was crafted by the author.
```

Comparing the two examples, the active voice sentence ("The author crafted a captivating story.") is more concise, powerful, and engaging. The passive voice sentence ("The captivating story was crafted by the author.") feels more distant and less direct.

In general, active voice is preferred in creative writing because it:

1. Creates a stronger, more immediate narrative
2. Avoids unnecessary wordiness
3. Emphasizes the subject's actions and agency
4. Engages the reader more effectively

Passive voice can be useful in specific instances, such as when the focus should be on the action or result rather than the subject. However, overuse of passive voice can make the writing feel stilted, unclear, or lacking in energy.
