Here's a list of action beats instead of dialogue tags for creative writing:

1. **Exhaled sharply**: "I can't believe this is happening," she *exhaled sharply*.
2. **Ran a hand through her hair**: "What are we going to do?" he *ran a hand through his hair*.
3. **Clenched her fists**: "I'll make them pay for this," she *clenched her fists*.
4. **Paced the room**: "I need to think this through," he *paced the room*.
5. **Tapped her foot**: "This is taking too long," she *tapped her foot*.
6. **Drummed her fingers on the table**: "We're running out of time," she *drummed her fingers on the table*.
7. **Leaned forward**: "Tell me everything you know," he *leaned forward*.
8. **Crossed her arms over her chest**: "I'm not going to let this happen," she *crossed her arms over her chest*.
9. **Chewed on her lip**: "I'm not sure I can do this," she *chewed on her lip*.
10. **Shook his head**: "This is a mistake," he *shook his head*.
11. **Fidgeted with her necklace**: "I'm so nervous," she *fidgeted with her necklace*.
12. **Clenched his jaw**: "I won't let them get away with this," he *clenched his jaw*.
13. **Ran her fingers through her hair**: "I need to clear my head," she *ran her fingers through her hair*.
14. **Tapped his foot impatiently**: "Hurry up, we don't have all day," he *tapped his foot impatiently*.
15. **Wrung her hands**: "I'm so worried," she *wrung her hands*.

Remember, these are just a few examples, and you can always come up with your own unique action beats to replace dialogue tags in your creative writing.

Example dialogue using the action beats:

"I don't think we should go that way," she frowned, glancing at the darkened alley.

"It'll be fine," he shrugged, already heading towards the alley. "Trust me."

She rolled her eyes. "Famous last words."

He chuckled. "Come on, it'll be an adventure."

"An adventure?" she huffed. "More like a death trap."

"Don't be so negative," he smiled, reaching for her hand. "It'll be fun, I promise."

She sighed, but allowed him to lead the way.
